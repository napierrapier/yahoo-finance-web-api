# Yahoo Finance API #

I make an online web API
which help to Display Stock Market data from **Yahoo Finance** in **_JSON_** and **_XML_** format
By sending a **HTTP GET** request you will easily collect data from **Yahoo Finance**

To get **Stock Market Data in XML** send a http **GET** request to **_http://surindrpal.web44.net/xml?s=XXXX_** here **XXXX** are the Market Quotes like **GOOG** for **Google Inc**,**MSFT** for **Microsoft**,**YHOO** for **Yahoo**
In same way you will collect **Stock Market Data in JSON** format send **GET** request to **_http://surindrpal.web44.net/json?s=XXXX_**
